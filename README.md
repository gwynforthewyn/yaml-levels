Toy project. Just counting down the levels of indentation that I reach in yaml, using a stack. I remembered the technique exists vaguely from the book 500 Lines or Less. I have some other yaml parsing projects I've been goofing around with for parsing the output of `helm values show`, so I wanted to recall the technique in an isolated environment.
