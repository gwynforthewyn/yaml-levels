Toy project. Just counting down the levels of indentation that I reach in yaml, using a stack. I remembered the technique exists vaguely from the book 500 Lines or Less. I have some other yaml parsing projects I've been goofing around with for parsing the output of `helm values show`, so I wanted to recall the technique in an isolated environment.

I can't imagine anyone would be interested by this, but fwiw the only way to run the code is with `go test` right now. The cmd directory is just there to get the main package out of the way.
